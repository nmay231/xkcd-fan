        </h2>
        <p>
            This site is a tribute to the funny and briliant cartoonist Randall Monroe. His comics
            are always a source of enjoyment for myself and for many scientists, mathematicians,
            computer specialists, and members of the general population.

            On this site, you can save a list of your favorites for easy access to show off
            to your friends and family whenever you need a good laugh, or just want to avoid normal
            socializing.
